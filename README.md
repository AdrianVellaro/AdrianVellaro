# 👋 Hi there, I'm Adrian!

I'm currently learning Java and building beginner projects to improve my coding skills. I wanna become a backend developer in the future! (lofty goal I know).

## 📚 Learning Journey

Here’s what I’m working through step-by-step (btw this is not THAT accurate, I just asked AI to generate this for me since I'm a lazy sack of shit.):

### ✅ Basics of Java
- [x] Printing text with `System.out.println`
- [x] Using variables and data types
- [x] Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- [x] Loops (`for`, `while`)
- [x] Random number generation
- [x] Getting user input with `Scanner`

### 🔄 Intermediate Concepts
- [x] Creating and calling methods
- [x] Organizing code into classes
- [x] Access modifiers and method return types
- [ ] Constructors and instance variables
- [ ] Simple error handling (`try` / `catch`)
- [ ] Basic arrays and loops with arrays

### 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] Creating objects from classes
- [ ] Understanding `this` keyword
- [ ] Using inheritance and subclasses
- [ ] Overriding methods
- [ ] Encapsulation and access control

- 🎲 **DiceRoller.java** – Simulates rolling dice
- 💬 **ChatBot.java** – A simple interactive chatbot
- 🧠 **EightBall.java** – Magic 8 Ball fortune teller
- 🔐 **Login.java** – Basic login system simulation
- 🔢 **Calculator2.java** – Console calculator with multiple operations
- 🎶 **PlaylistShuffle.java** – Random playlist shuffle simulator
- 💼 **MainBank.java & savingsAccount.java** – Starting to explore banking logic in OOP
